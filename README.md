# Description

This is a game that I created to my dad, He likes retro games so I made a custom Space Invaders with our family's faces (My dad, my sister and me). This project help myself, cause I learned about python classes and objects. So thanks dad! (He offered me a reward if I programmed a game).

Actually, If you know how, you are able to edit all.

# Comments ❤️

This is a very basic game, and as you can see, it does not have beautiful aesthetic details, but I did it with love! I encourage you to fix a few things and make your own game!, like graphic design, texts, add a background image, a cover, be able to restart the game and even add extra lives!
